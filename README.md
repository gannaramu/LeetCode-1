# README #

This is a project that I created to attempt some solutions for the questions in LeetCode site. Most of the solutions are coded in Java, though some of them are implemented in Python.

### Organization ###

* Usually a source file corresponds to solutions to a single question.
* In some cases, I aggregated several solutions into a single file to several questions that share the same context or spirit.
